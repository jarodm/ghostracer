<p><em><b>Ghostrunner</b></em> allows you to track your progress against a goal and provides real-time status to help you make your target.  Beat your previous <b>personal record</b>, attempt to match your friend's personal record, or set a new goal.  Using GPS technology, the app tracks your distance and speed, then lets you know when to push that extra bit harder to make your goal.  The post-run summary provides information on your progress as well as what you would need to do to close the gap.</p><br>
